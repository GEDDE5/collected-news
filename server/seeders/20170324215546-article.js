        GUATEMALA CITY â€“  The death toll in a fire at a Guatemalan children\'s shelter has risen
        to 41 after another girl died of her injuries. The attorney general\'s office said Friday
        the girl died after being transferred for treatment to a hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio.
        She was one of nine girls transferred for treatment to   hospitals in the United States.
        Nineteen of the adolescents perished at the scene of the March 8 fire and 22 others have
        died at hospitals. The fire began when mattresses were set ablaze during a protest by
        residents at the overcrowded youth shelter. Guatemalan authorities have arrested three
        former child welfare officials who were responsible for overseeing the youth shelter.`,
